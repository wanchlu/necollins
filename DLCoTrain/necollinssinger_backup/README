Files are:

[1] data      = unlabelled data used for the experiments
[2] seedRules = seed rules used by the classifier
[3] test      = test set
[4] test.gold = labels for test set

Notes about the various file formats:

[1] data is in format

-1 <list of features>

contextual features are prefixed by X01 X11 or X3
spelling features are all other features

[2] seedrules is in format

label seed strength

where label is 1/2/3 for location/person/organization

[3] test = testset, in format

-1 features

[4] test.gold = labels for the test set (line by line correspondance)

where label is 1/2/3/4 for location/person/organization/noise
